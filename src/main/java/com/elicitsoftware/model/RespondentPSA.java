/**
 * Represents a respondent in a survey system. A respondent is associated with a survey
 * and interacts with it through various actions such as accessing and submitting responses.
 * This entity tracks key events and properties of the respondent's interaction with the survey.
 * <p>
 * The Respondent entity is mapped to the "respondents" table within the "survey" schema
 * and is managed through JPA. It supports named queries for retrieving specific respondent
 * data based on survey and token criteria.
 * <p>
 * Key features of this class include:
 * - Tracking of creation, first access, and finalization timestamps.
 * - Management of an active status to indicate if the respondent is currently participating.
 * - Storage of a unique token to identify individual respondents securely.
 * - Reference to the associated survey.
 * <p>
 * Named Queries:
 * - "Respondent.findBySurveyAndToken": Finds a respondent by the given survey ID and token.
 * - "Respondent.findActiveByToken": Retrieves active respondents associated with a specific token,
 * ordered by survey ID.
 * <p>
 * The entity includes utility methods such as:
 * - `findBySurveyAndToken`: Static method to retrieve a respondent based on survey ID and token.
 * - `getElapsedTime`: Calculates the elapsed time between the first access and finalization
 * timestamps, if available, formatted as HH:mm:ss.
